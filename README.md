Here's a possible course content for a beginner's Java course, divided into modules with increasing complexity:

*Module 1: Introduction to Java and Programming

What is Java? Its history, applications, and career opportunities.
Basics of programming: Concepts like variables, data types, operators, control flow (if/else, loops), and functions.
Setting up the development environment: Installing Java and using an IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Simple Java programs: Writing your first programs with console input/output, calculations, and logic statements. 

*Module 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes and Objects: Building objects and understanding their properties and methods.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: Reusing code through inheritance and implementing different behaviors with polymorphism.
Encapsulation and Access Modifiers: Controlling access to object data and methods for better security and code organization.
Working with Packages: Organizing code into namespaces for improved clarity and modularity.

*Module 3: Data Structures and Collections

Arrays: Storing and accessing data sequences with ordered indexing.
Lists: Dynamically expandable collections like ArrayList and LinkedList for flexible data storage.
Sets: Unique elements without duplicates, using HashSet and TreeSet for efficient membership checks.
Maps: Key-value pairs, utilizing HashMap and TreeMap for key-based data retrieval and organization.

*Module 4: Input/Output and String Manipulation

Reading and writing files: Working with text and binary files using File, FileReader, FileWriter, and Scanner classes.
String operations: Manipulating strings with methods like substring, replace, and regular expressions.
Formatting and parsing: Converting data types and displaying information with printf and Scanner.

Module 5: Advanced Topics (Optional)

Java Streams and Lambdas: Functional programming techniques for concise data processing (for Java 8 and later).
Networking and Database Access: Building network applications and connecting to databases (optional depending on course length).
Multithreading: Concurrency concepts for running multiple tasks simultaneously (optional for beginners).
